In recent years, the debate between microservices and monolithic architectures has occupied a central place in software engineering discussions.

But in 2024, does it still make sense to place these two architectural choices in opposition?

The answer is: IT DEPENDS.

Let's explore the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in today's context.

#### Monolithic Architecture: A Classic Still Valid?

A monolithic architecture is an application built as a single indivisible block, where all functionalities are tightly integrated.

This approach, although traditional, still has its merits:

Advantages:

Development simplicity: ideal for small teams or applications with limited scope;
Ease of testing: the unified nature simplifies writing end-to-end tests;
Unified deployment: a single artifact simplifies the deployment process;
Performance: the absence of overhead related to communication between services reduces latency times;
Disadvantages:

Limited scalability: scaling a monolith means scaling the entire application, even when only one part requires additional resources;
Complex updates: small changes may require complete redeployment;
Technical debt: as they grow, monoliths become difficult to manage, with intricate interdependencies;

#### Microservices: A Mature Model?

Microservices divide an application into small independent services that communicate with each other. This model has gained popularity in large companies, but is it suitable for all realities?

Advantages:

Targeted scalability: Each service can be scaled independently, reducing resource consumption;
Team independence: Teams can work on different services without conflicts;
Heterogeneous technologies: Allows the use of different stacks for each service;
Resilience: A problem in one service does not compromise the entire application;
Disadvantages:

Greater complexity: Managing multiple services and communication is more complex;
Operational overhead: Monitoring and security require advanced tools;
Costs: Cloud resources and tools to manage a distributed architecture can be expensive;
Coordination: Ensuring consistency and synchronization between services is challenging;

#### So? Microservices or Monoliths?

The real question is not whether to choose microservices or monoliths, but how to adopt the best of both. Many organizations are in fact adopting a hybrid approach, known as 'modular monolith', which combines the strengths of both.

When to choose a monolith: small projects or proof of concept, teams with limited resources, applications that don't require extreme scalability.

When to choose microservices: complex systems with high scalability and resilience requirements, organizations with distributed and specialized teams, need to adopt different technologies for different components.

#### The Future Is in the Modular Approach

Tools like Kubernetes and other cloud-native platforms make it easier to manage the complexities of microservices.

However, modern monoliths can be designed in a modular way, allowing a future transition to microservices without rewriting everything from scratch.

In 2024, discussing microservices versus monoliths is no longer a matter of 'either/or'.

It's about evaluating the specific needs of the project and choosing a pragmatic approach.

It's not the architecture that defines a product's success, but how it's implemented and adapted to the needs of the business and users.
