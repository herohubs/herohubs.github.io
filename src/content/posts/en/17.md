In recent years, few roles have gained as much relevance as those of data engineers and data analysts.

Yet, despite the enormous demand for these professionals, their work often risks being trapped in a paradox: producing information without ensuring its effective use.

The problem does not lie in the lack of technical skills.

On the contrary, those working in this sector master advanced tools like SQL, Python, and large-scale data processing platforms.

Countless hours of work are invested in perfecting pipelines, optimizing databases, and creating sophisticated dashboards.

But in the end, does all this effort translate into significant impact?

#### Data that stays on paper

Imagine an office full of printed reports and unread spreadsheets.

In the digital context, this scenario translates into forgotten dashboards, underutilized pipelines, and metrics that no one consults. It's a situation that many data professionals know well, even if it is rarely discussed openly.

Why does it happen?

Often, attention is focused exclusively on 'how'.

How to process, how to represent, how to structure. Never enough on why.

As a result, many solutions, while technically brilliant, fail to respond to actual business needs, becoming academic exercises devoid of practical applications.

#### From executors to strategic partners

The turning point for a data professional comes when they stop considering themselves mere executors and begin to think as strategic partners.

This change requires deep reflection: it is not enough to satisfy operational requests; it is fundamental to ask what added value their work can bring to the organization as a whole.

How to make this leap? Here are some reflections:

Reading between the lines of requests: when a manager asks for a report or a new metric, the data professional must go beyond the surface. The real question is rarely explicit: 'How much are we spending on marketing?' could translate into more complex needs, such as measuring campaign effectiveness, identifying underutilized channels, or improving ROI. This ability to go beyond explicit requests represents the first step in building truly useful solutions;

Speaking the business language: data and numbers are universal, but their meaning depends on context. An effective data analyst knows how to translate technical metrics into clear and understandable insights for decision-makers. Often, this means shifting the focus from tables to narratives. Numbers, no matter how precise, remain valueless if not accompanied by a story that connects them to business objectives and explains how they can inspire concrete actions;

Measuring the impact of one's work: it is not enough to create pipelines or dashboards; it is fundamental to monitor their use and impact. Who consults them? How do they influence strategic decisions? What problems have they helped solve? These questions allow verifying if one's work is generating real value for the organization, going beyond mere operational fulfillment;

Anticipating business needs: the value of a data professional does not reside solely in the ability to respond to requests, but also in proactivity in identifying problems and opportunities. For example, detecting emerging trends in data before they become problematic allows positioning the company ahead of competitors. This forward-looking vision transforms the data professional from an operational figure to a strategic resource;

#### The role of data leaders

This shift in perspective does not concern only individual professionals.

Data sector leaders have a crucial responsibility: creating an ecosystem that values data and its strategic use.

What does that mean defining clear priorities, aligned with the organization's strategic objectives; providing the team with context and autonomy to explore innovative solutions; celebrating successes that demonstrate real impact, to strengthen the culture of data-based analysis.

#### Data that makes a difference

Data represents enormous potential.

Their power, however, is nothing without direction.

For data professionals, the challenge is to go beyond technical competence and become change agents.

This requires the courage to exit the comfort zone, question superficial requests, and focus on long-term impact.

At the end, the success of a data engineer or analyst is not measured by the number of lines of code written or reports produced, but by their ability to positively influence decisions and the future of an organization.

Therefore, the next time you approach a new project, ask yourself: am I simply creating data or am I building value?

Only by asking ourselves this question can we transform our approach and make data work truly meaningful.
