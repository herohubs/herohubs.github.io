When we think about operating systems, we often recall the familiar Windows logo or, for some, the iconic minimalism of macOS.

But behind the scenes of our digital world there is a less known protagonist, but omnipresent: Linux.

We could define it as the "Swiss army knife" of computing, but that would be reductive.

Linux is everywhere, even if many don't realize it. Here's why.

Your personal PC probably uses Windows or macOS, but as soon as we move outside the world of personal computers, Linux dominates the landscape:

Routers and networks: your home router uses Linux, as do those of your Internet service provider (ISP).

Web servers: almost all successful and scalable web servers run on Linux. About 95% of the 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world use Linux, making it the standard for high-performance computing.

Datacenters: the infrastructures that power the cloud, streaming services, social media, and even online gaming platforms? All based on Linux.

Smart devices: your smart TV, your connected appliances, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices rely on Linux to function efficiently and securely.

Cars and mobility: the onboard systems of modern cars, including autonomous vehicles, run on Linux. Tesla, for example, uses a customized version of Linux.

Smartphones: Android smartphones run on Linux. And even your iPhone uses a "Unix-based" operating system, which shares many principles with Linux.

#### The ecosystem of collaboration

One of the reasons Linux is so widespread is its open source nature. This means that anyone can access the source code, modify it, and adapt it to their needs. It is an extraordinary example of global collaboration: thousands of developers around the world contribute to making it better every day.

This collaborative approach has led to the creation of Linux distributions optimized for every need: from enterprise servers (like Ubuntu Server or CentOS) to embedded systems for IoT devices.

Every sector has its version of Linux, and this makes it incredibly versatile.

But why does it dominate?

Linux has become the de facto standard for many critical applications for some key reasons:

Stability and reliability: Linux-based systems can run for years without needing restarts, making it ideal for servers and critical infrastructures.

Security: Linux is known for being highly secure, thanks to its modular structure and the active community that quickly fixes vulnerabilities.

Flexibility: Linux can be customized to adapt to any type of hardware, from supercomputers to small IoT sensors.

Zero cost: being open source, there are no licensing costs, making it the preferred choice for startups, tech companies, and cloud giants.

#### Continuous innovation

The latest versions of the Linux kernel continue to redefine technological innovation standards.

With each update, the system becomes increasingly versatile, perfectly adapting to the needs of an ever-evolving technological landscape.

Thanks to extended support for the latest AMD and Intel processors, Linux establishes itself as an ideal choice for users seeking high-level performance.

The optimizations introduced in network configurations and storage make it an unbeatable solution for datacenters and servers handling complex workloads. On the security front, new features are implemented to defend modern infrastructures from increasingly sophisticated attacks.

Finally, Linux further consolidates itself in the world of mobility and IoT.

Its ability to guarantee lightness, stability, and reliability makes it the reference operating system for connected devices, small and large.

A true cornerstone of global innovation.

Linux and the future of technology
With the advancement of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and IoT, Linux confirms itself at the center of technological innovations. Projects like Kubernetes, which revolutionize the world of cloud computing, and Android, which dominates the smartphone market, are based on Linux.

Also in the educational sector, Linux is gaining ground: many universities and technical training courses use Linux to teach programming, system administration, and cybersecurity. This means that future generations of IT professionals will continue to rely on it.

A silent hero
In essence, every time you turn on a device, watch a streaming video, or book an online trip, you are probably using a system powered by Linux.

It is not just an operating system, but the backbone of our digital ecosystem.

Its omnipresence is not a coincidence, but the result of decades of development, innovation, and global collaboration.

Without Linux, the digital world we know today would not exist.
