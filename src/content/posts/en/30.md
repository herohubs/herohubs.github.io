A few years ago, in one of the companies we worked for, we had reached such a high level of serenity and cohesion that on August 16th, although being in the office, we decided to have a barbecue among colleagues not on vacation.

We had a panoramic terrace, so we brought a barbecue directly to the office to enjoy a moment of conviviality together.

Imagine a colleague entering the office with a barbecue in hand – not even too small – passing in front of everyone. Smiling.

No one complained, on the contrary, managers and executives joined us, creating a relaxed atmosphere that allowed us to establish better relationships and then return to work more energized than before. That barbecue was not a strategy to show how 'trendy' we were on social media, but a spontaneous example of a cohesive group that worked together with passion and dedication.

Something born like that, by chance.

Unfortunately, today it seems that the true essence of team collaboration is often reduced to posting smiling photos on social media. Teams posing at the pub, managers and executives smiling in front of a whiteboard in a meeting that seems more like a scene for LinkedIn than an authentic work moment. Group games, laser tag, and the more, the merrier.

These shots do not tell the true synergy that is built day by day. Collaboration between developers, managers, and executives is made of daily challenges, clear communication, transparency, respect, mutual trust.

Here are some fundamental aspects to truly improve this relationship, going beyond the facade of social media and facing real work and life.

#### 1. Work Estimates and Deadlines: Realism and Flexibility

One of the main difficulties in collaboration between developers and managers is the management of work estimates.

Developers cannot always foresee in advance all the difficulties they will encounter in developing a new feature. Managers and executives must adopt a flexible and realistic approach in time estimates, allowing a margin for unforeseen events and complications.

Too often, on social media we see images of teams that 'achieve every goal' or 'face challenges' without difficulties, but in reality it is fundamental to be realistic in forecasts to avoid frustrations.

Planning must be dynamic and adaptable, just as good leadership should be: flexible and not rigid.

#### 2. Creativity and Software Development: A Delicate Balance

Software development is not just a matter of writing code, but also of creativity.

Developers can experience moments of 'flow' where work flows easily, but also periods where concentration is harder to maintain. In these moments, micromanagement and constant pressure from managers can reduce work quality, interrupting the creative flow.

But on social media, too often, we see images showing smiling leaders, who seem to have everything under control, giving the impression that work flows without problems.

Reality is quite different: support for creativity requires trust, not obsessive control.

#### 3. Technical Understanding and Effective Communication

One of the major obstacles to collaboration between managers and developers is the gap in technical knowledge.

Managers must understand the basics of the development process, but without oversimplifying technical difficulties. This does not mean becoming experts, but acquiring an understanding that helps make informed decisions. Executives, on the other hand, must make an effort to communicate clearly and understandably, avoiding technical jargon that can be incomprehensible.

However, while on social media there is a tendency to exalt 'immediate success', true collaboration is built through clear and constant dialogue, where all involved parties are aware of the challenges and solutions.

#### 4. Technical Debt: A Problem to Manage with Care

Technical debt is an aspect that is often ignored to favor speed. However, as managers and executives know, ignoring it can compromise the future development of the product.

In environments where appearance seems more important than substance, one prefers to avoid talking about technical debt so as not to 'spoil' the image of a project that seems to advance without hitches.

But reality is that a good manager must address technical debt seriously and not seek easy solutions to exhibit on social media. Managing it correctly ensures the sustainability of the product over time, without compromising development speed.

#### 5. Clear Definition of Requirements: Precision Makes the Difference

A vague specification can generate confusion and slowdowns, leading the team to interpret the same concepts differently.

A good manager must be precise and clear in requests, avoiding vagueness that can compromise work quality. We cannot afford to fall into the trap of promoting on social media images of teams that 'work perfectly' when, in reality, confused and unclear requests are the origin of many problems in daily work.

A clear definition of requirements is the key to avoiding misunderstandings and ensuring the team works efficiently.

#### 6. Roles and Responsibilities: Defining Boundaries

An effective manager should not micromanage developers by telling them how to do their job, but should focus on what needs to be achieved.

This approach allows developers to make the best use of their experience and competence. The leadership of an executive must be based on respect for roles and autonomy, without trying to control every single detail, as it may appear in the 'perfect' photos on social media that tell of absolute control.

#### 7. Trust and Autonomy: The Engine of Collaboration

Mutual trust is the basis of every successful collaboration.

A manager who places trust in their team must leave space for developers to organize their work autonomously.

This type of trust, which does not appear in photos of smiling teams on social media, is what truly motivates a team to achieve ambitious goals, creating a healthy and productive work environment.

#### 8. Adaptation of Work Methods: Flexibility in Methodologies

Methodologies like Scrum and Agile are useful tools, but they must be adapted to the team's and project's needs.

Following them rigidly to "make a scene" on social media can be counterproductive, leading to a formal and ineffective application of practices. Managers and executives must be flexible in using project management tools, optimizing workflows based on the team's real needs.

True synergy is not built with images on social media, but with open dialogue, mutual trust, and continuous commitment in resolving daily challenges. Authentic collaboration is the one that leads to quality results and a healthy work environment, far from the superficiality of LinkedIn posts.
