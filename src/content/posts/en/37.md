In recent years, web development tools have multiplied and multiplied: ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting, Babel for transpilation, TypeScript for static analysis. Each with its configurations, its dependencies, and its integration problems. A lot of confusion and a lot of work to maintain.

In this context, Biome presents itself as a unified, fast, and modern solution, designed to reduce complexity and improve developer productivity.

Biome is a complete toolchain, built with particular attention to consistency and performance. It was written in Rust and manages to offer an extremely fast experience compared to traditional JavaScript-based tools. The philosophy behind the project is clear: simplify.

One tool, one parser, one centralized configuration that allows managing linting, formatting, and, if desired, code transformations as well, with consistency and without redundancies.

One of the aspects that strikes right away is the ease with which Biome can be introduced into an existing project. It can be installed with any modern package manager, from npm to bun, or download a standalone executable directly, useful for those who prefer to avoid dependencies tied to Node.js. Installation is quick and, above all, does not require a long chain of plugins or configurations. With a single command (biome init), you can generate the base configuration file that regulates the entire behavior of the tool. It is an approach that winks at Prettier's philosophy, but with much more depth and control.

Unlike other fragmented solutions, Biome really centralizes everything. Linting does not require installing external packages or additional rules: once configured, it is already able to analyze JavaScript and TypeScript files, including JSX and TSX, detecting common problems and offering corrective suggestions. At the same time, the code formatting function ensures consistent style throughout the project, applying precise rules with impressive speed, even on large codebases.

Another strength of Biome is its seamless integration with the development environment.

Those using Visual Studio Code can install the official extension that allows real-time linting, automatic formatting on save, and centralized settings management. No more juggling between .eslintrc, .prettierrc, and a thousand other plugins.

Everything happens naturally and predictably.

Not less important, Biome adapts perfectly to automated workflows as well. It can be easily integrated into CI/CD processes, thanks to an official action for GitHub that allows running linting and formatting every time a pull request is opened. This allows maintaining high code quality, without having to intervene manually during review.

Biome's approach is pragmatic: no external plugins, no infinite configurations.

The toolchain directly provides everything needed to write cleaner and more consistent code, with superior performance. This has a significant impact even in professional contexts, where the speed of tools can concretely influence development time and team work fluidity.

The feeling you get using Biome is that of having finally found a tool born to solve developers' daily problems, without compromises. It is not just a modern alternative to ESLint or Prettier: it is a redefinition of the very concept of toolchain for the front-end. Anyone who has worked on complex projects knows how frustrating it can be to keep multiple tools synchronized that often overlap or conflict.

Biome cuts short: one engine, one parsing cycle, one source of truth.

The project is still evolving and, although some advanced features are experimental or in roadmap, the base is already solid. Support for CSS, for example, is planned but not yet available, as well as a customizable plugin system. However, for those working with JavaScript and TypeScript, Biome is already today a mature, fast, and reliable solution.

Biome represents a paradigm shift: fewer tools to manage, fewer dependencies to update, fewer configurations to align among team members. And all this without sacrificing quality, in fact elevating it thanks to the consistency and speed of its Rust engine.

It is a tool worth trying, and that could easily become the new standard for those seeking efficiency and simplicity in modern development.
