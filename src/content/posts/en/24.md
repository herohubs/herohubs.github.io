A few days ago, Elon Musk launched Grok3, the most powerful chatbot from xAI, his startup dedicated to artificial intelligence.

Presented as a model capable of surpassing industry giants like GPT-4o from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic and Google Gemini, Grok3 promises to redefine AI standards.

But there's a detail that many have underestimated: the acquisition of Twitter (now X) was not just a social move, but a key strategy to train Grok3.

When Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, many thought of his impulsive character. In reality, behind that operation there was a very precise vision: Twitter was, and is, a goldmine of data. Both real-time and historical.

Today renamed X, it is one of the richest platforms in human conversations, opinions, trends and social interactions and these data are fundamental to train a language model like Grok3, which must understand not only formal language, but also slang, emotions and cultural context.

Unlike static datasets, X's data are dynamic and constantly evolving.

This allows Grok3 to stay updated on global events, trends and emerging languages.

Furthermore, the acquisition of the social network allowed Musk to integrate Grok3 directly into the platform, creating a unique ecosystem where AI can interact with users in a contextual and immediate way.

#### Grok3 exploits X's data

Grok3 is not just an advanced language model; it is a product of the X ecosystem.

Thanks to privileged access to the platform's data, it has been trained on billions of tweets, posts, interactions, users and their sentiments, acquiring a unique understanding of human language and social dynamics.

One of the most innovative features is 'DeepSearch', a tool that allows Grok3 to offer responses based on real-time trends, analyzing not only static information but also the 'pulse' of the network.

Furthermore, integration with X allows the chatbot to adapt to individual user preferences, offering more relevant and personalized responses.

X's data have three fundamental characteristics: volume, variety and speed.

Every day millions of tweets are published, creating an enormous and diversified dataset that covers any topic, from memes to global news. And being a real-time platform, it is also the fastest way to follow events, making it ideal for training an AI that must respond promptly and accurately.

Not everything, however, is without challenges.

The use of X's data raises important ethical issues, including user privacy and the risk of bias. Since tweets can contain prejudices and disinformation, there is a risk that Grok3 may reflect such distortions in its outputs.

Recently, the chatbot generated controversy by blocking responses that implied that Elon Musk and Donald Trump were sources of disinformation.

The head of xAI engineering attributed this incident to an unauthorized system update by a former OpenAI employee. This episode highlights the ongoing challenges related to content moderation and the integrity of AI-generated responses.

#### And the competitors?

While GPT-4o, Google Gemini and others are based on static datasets and web searches, Grok3 has a unique advantage: access to X's data and this allows it to respond more contextually, better understand sarcasm, humor and informal languages and update constantly without the need for complex new training cycles.

xAI claims that Grok3 Reasoning surpasses the best version of OpenAI's GPT in several benchmarks, including advanced math tests.

However, independent tests will be necessary to confirm these claims.

#### Grok3 is a game-changer

Musk didn't buy Twitter to be the king of social media.

He did it to build the future of artificial intelligence.

Grok3 is the result of this vision: a chatbot that not only answers questions, but understands them in the context of an always connected world. While its performance still needs to be independently verified, its potential is clear.

However, for Grok3 to truly establish itself as the reference AI model, xAI will have to effectively address the ethical and moderation challenges.
