Planning and executing software projects is a complex challenge.

Every project carries the risk of recurring problems: sometimes you build something that doesn't meet user needs, other times you exceed timelines and costs.

Yet, addressing these difficulties in a structured way can make the difference between a successful project and one that fails.

Over the years, an approach has emerged that is based on three fundamental pillars: correctly defining the project scope, establishing clear milestones, and proceeding with effective execution.

#### Project Scope

Everything starts from an idea.

Someone in the company proposes a new feature, or there is a need to create an internal tool.

Often, behind these ideas lies an expectation of timelines that is not made explicit: 'it will take three months' is a thought that might seem harmless, but it translates into concrete resources like salaries, team time, and budget.

Defining a clear scope is crucial to avoid misunderstandings.

Before starting, it is useful to align the team on objectives and constraints: how much time do we have? What is the maximum budget? The clearer the limits, the easier it is to find creative solutions.

In larger projects, where uncertainty increases, it becomes fundamental to divide the work into phases. This helps avoid falling into the trap of dedicating an entire year to something that could be validated with a leaner approach.

#### Clear Milestones

When tackling complex projects, milestones are not just steps along the path, but tools for clarity.

A good milestone not only helps progress towards the goal, but also tests hypotheses, reduces uncertainties, and keeps the team flexible.

For example, suppose we want to develop an internal tool to optimize a business process.

Instead of immediately building a complex interface, a first milestone could be creating a simple prototype with a low-code tool.

This approach allows collecting initial feedback without committing too many resources.

A well-designed milestone should answer an essential question: could we stop here? If the answer is yes, then we are on the right track.

#### Execution as a Key Element

Defining a plan is important, but what determines success is how it is implemented.

During execution, it is fundamental to work in short iterations, allowing constant feedback and quick course corrections.

Start by exploring different possible solutions and then gradually narrow the focus to balance creativity and pragmatism. This approach, called 'divergence and convergence', is particularly useful when facing innovative or uncertain projects.

It is equally important to keep an eye on the context.

How much time does the team really have? What other responsibilities might interfere?

Answering these questions helps avoid unnecessary deviations and keep the project on schedule.

#### The Recipe for Success

A well-executed software project is never a coincidence.

It requires a clear vision, a flexible plan, and disciplined execution.

The chances of success increase significantly if you manage to:

define a realistic and shared scope;
establish milestones that reduce uncertainties;
work with short iterations and measurable objectives;
When planning your next project, ask yourself: are you solving the right problem? Are you making the best use of the time and resources available?

With careful planning and good execution, it is possible to build something of value without getting lost along the way.
