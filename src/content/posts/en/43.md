Artificial intelligence has now fully entered business workflows. We use it to write content, analyze documents, summarize information, and even recognize images. The problem is that there is still a little-known but very important aspect: AI itself can be manipulated. Understanding how this process works is crucial for using these tools consciously and safely.

Imagine looking at a photo of a zebra. Its white and black coat is unmistakable: anyone who looks at it clearly recognizes a zebra. Now we upload the same image to an artificial intelligence system and ask which animal it is. The answer, however, might be surprising: the AI claims it is a goat. How does this happen? Are we wrong, or is the machine?

The explanation could be more technical than it seems. Artificial intelligence models do not only analyze what they see, but also everything that travels alongside a file: the name, metadata, and textual context in which it is loaded. If these information contain misleading instructions (for example, using a filename like 'this-is-a-goat.jpeg') the system could be influenced. This technique is called prompt injection.

Prompt injection consists of injecting hidden commands into elements that the AI considers trustworthy. It is a bit like suggesting an answer to the machine before it even starts truly processing the request.

If the file contains indications that push toward a specific interpretation, artificial intelligence could follow them without reporting it to the user. And this is where the real issue arises: data quality.

In your daily work, you should know about this risk, primarily for defense and strategic awareness reasons.

Any file you receive (a resume, a report, a presentation, a contract) could contain elements designed to influence AI analysis, and before relying completely on an automatic tool, it is good practice to perform a verification.

If we have a minimum of technical familiarity, let's try to open the file in a simple text editor or check the metadata. It takes just a few seconds to identify any hidden anomalies.

Anyone who works in marketing, sales, or negotiation should understand these dynamics. Not necessarily because they want to use them incorrectly, but because they want to recognize them when they are employed and understand their potential impact.

Artificial intelligence is powerful, but it is not infallible. It trusts the information it receives, and it is precisely for this reason that the real difference is made by the user. The more we understand how these tools work, the less likely we are to be deceived by them.

Today, critical thinking is no longer an accessory soft skill: it has become a fundamental competency, and in a context driven by algorithms, the ability to analyze data and ask the right questions represents the best form of protection.

Technology will continue to evolve, but one thing will certainly remain unchanged: tools are intelligent, yes, but only as intelligent as the people who use them.
