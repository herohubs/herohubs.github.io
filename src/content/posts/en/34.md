The ability to write clearly and effectively is often overlooked, considered secondary to more technical skills; yet, more and more organizations are realizing that good writing is one of the most strategic skills a developer or manager can develop.

Writing is not just a means to document decisions or specifications: it is the foundation of communication, collaboration, and alignment in any structured technical context.

In the daily activity of a development team, writing is everywhere.

We find it in code comments, in drafting technical specifications, in strategy documents, in internal guidelines, in incident management, and even in short messages on Slack.

It is through writing that context is shared, objectives are clarified, and ambiguities are reduced. In the absence of effective written communication, misunderstandings grow, work duplication increases, and the risk of error multiplies.

Imagining an organization where all communication was entrusted exclusively to speech is enough to realize the importance of writing. Speech, by its nature, is ephemeral and not scalable. A verbal communication must be repeated every time it is needed, while a well-formulated written message can be shared, archived, and understood even after a long time.

It is a form of communication that remains and allows building a shared memory over time. This is particularly important when working in distributed teams or managing long-term projects.

Imagine onboarding a new colleague and not having a document that introduces them to the company context, the product, the project they will work on. Technical specifications? Development environment setup? Every time the same story: working together to perform a task that could have been done autonomously and without the stress of having someone beside them. Much more convenient to have a setup document (which must be kept updated, of course) to pass in PDF format. They read it, act, and configure the environment. In a few hours, they are operational.

Writing, in an engineering context, is not only a tool for transmitting information, but also a means to improve one's thinking. Writing forces one to clarify their ideas, to give shape to still raw intuitions, to confront the incompleteness of certain solutions; just as writing clean code requires an orderly mental structure, technical writing also requires rigor, precision, and synthesis ability. Not surprisingly, the most advanced tech companies have made writing one of the pillars of their organizational culture.

When we talk about effective writing, we tend to think of long and articulated texts. In reality, the true skill lies in knowing how to convey a lot with little. A short but well-written message, which clarifies in a few lines the status of a project or the implications of a technical decision, is worth more than a long email full of redundant details. Similarly, a technical specification that anticipates the reader's questions, that explicates constraints and edge cases, helps the entire team to move with greater security.

In all this, technical leaders play a fundamental role. Those who lead a team, or contribute to defining the company's technical direction, must know how to write to influence, to clarify the vision, and to facilitate decisions. A good technical strategy, for example, is not just a sequence of architectural decisions: it is a coherent narrative that helps the organization understand where it wants to go and why. If it is not written in an understandable and engaging way, it risks remaining dead letter.

Writing well, therefore, is not a talent reserved for copywriters or communicators. It is a skill that is built over time, with practice, and with awareness. The first step is to have experienced certain problems firsthand, to understand that certain documents would have been very useful in certain situations, and then to understand one's communicative objective: who are you writing to? What is the key message you want to convey? What action or understanding do you want to obtain from the reader? Only starting from these questions can one define an adequate tone, a coherent structure, and truly useful content.

Another fundamental aspect is simplicity. Too often one tries to seem intelligent with complex sentences or specialized terms, but the real impact comes when one manages to say difficult things in a simple way. This does not mean trivializing, but making one's thought accessible even to those with less context or less experience. Eliminate the superfluous, avoid circumlocutions, prefer active verbs: all this contributes to improving readability and therefore the effectiveness of the message.

Finally, there is no better way to improve than to write often.

Publishing online, even informally, helps to receive feedback, to refine one's voice, and to get used to expressing one's ideas in an orderly way. After years of writing, I can say that our ability to think, explain, and make decisions has improved significantly. Writing trains one to be clearer, more empathetic, and more persuasive.

For a developer or a manager, writing well is not an ornament, but a lever for growth.

In a sector where complexity is the norm and collaboration is indispensable, those who know how to communicate with clarity have a concrete advantage. It is time to treat writing for what it is: a strategic tool and a silent ally in doing things well.
