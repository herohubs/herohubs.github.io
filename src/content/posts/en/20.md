In recent years, we have had the opportunity to work closely with Firebase's real-time database, a solution that proved fundamental for a project where it was necessary to display and monitor real-time data coming from mobile applications on a web application browsable via browser.

The experience allowed us to deeply appreciate this tool's potential, but also to evaluate some of its limits.

Today, we want to share with you a detailed analysis of Firebase's real-time database, exploring its pros, cons, alternatives, and costs, and explaining why it might be the right choice for your next application or platform.

#### What is Firebase's real-time database?

Firebase's real-time database is a NoSQL cloud-hosted database that allows storing and synchronizing data in real time between all connected clients.

Unlike traditional databases, which require polling operations to update data (oh!), Firebase uses a WebSocket-based system, ensuring immediate updates as soon as data changes.

This makes it ideal for applications requiring real-time synchronization, such as chat, monitoring dashboards, multiplayer games, and much more.

#### The main advantages of Firebase's real-time database

Real-time updates: the main feature is the ability to synchronize data between all connected devices in milliseconds. In our case, the system administrator could see data uploaded by mobile app users immediately, making operational decisions in real time.

Ease of integration: Firebase offers SDKs for all major platforms (iOS, Android, Web) and integrates seamlessly with other Firebase services, such as Authentication, Cloud Functions, and Hosting. This greatly reduces development times.

Scalability: being a Google-managed service, Firebase scales automatically based on workload, without requiring manual interventions.

Offline-first: the real-time database supports offline mode, storing data locally on the device and synchronizing with the server once connection is restored. This is particularly useful for mobile apps used in areas with limited connectivity.

Low initial costs: Firebase offers a generous free plan, ideal for startups and small projects. Costs increase based on usage, but remain competitive compared to other cloud solutions.

#### The limits of Firebase's real-time database

Hierarchical data structure: being a NoSQL database, data is organized in a tree structure (JSON-like). This can make complex queries or operations on relational data complicated.

Query limitations: queries are less powerful than those of a traditional SQL database. For example, it is not possible to execute joins or complex queries on multiple fields.

Long-term costs: although the free plan is generous, costs can grow rapidly for applications with high data volume or many active users.

Vendor lock-in: using Firebase means relying on Google. If in the future you decide to migrate to another platform, the process could be complex.

#### Alternatives on the market

If Firebase is not the solution for your project, there are several equally valid alternatives:

Firestore: also Firebase, Firestore is an evolution of the real-time database, with a more flexible data structure and more powerful queries. It is ideal for complex applications.

Supabase: a valid open-source alternative, Supabase combines a PostgreSQL database with real-time functionalities, offering greater flexibility and control.

AWS AppSync: Amazon Web Services' service for real-time applications, based on GraphQL. It is particularly suitable for projects already integrated into the AWS ecosystem.

Pusher: more oriented towards real-time notifications, Pusher is great for applications requiring instant updates but not needing a complete database.

#### Why adopt a real-time database?

Using a real-time database is essential for applications requiring immediate data synchronization between multiple devices.

Here are some scenarios where Firebase's real-time database shines:

Real-time monitoring: dashboards for administrators who need to view live data.

Collaborative applications: text editors, shared whiteboards, or planning tools.

Chat and notifications: messaging applications requiring instant updates.

Multiplayer games: state synchronization between multiple players.

#### And the costs?

Firebase uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

The free plan includes:

1 GB of storage
10 GB of data transfer per month
100 simultaneous connections
Costs increase based on usage, with prices starting from:

~5$ per additional GB of storage
~1$ per additional GB of data transfer
For large-scale projects, it is advisable to use Firestore, which offers more predictable pricing and advanced features.

Firebase's real-time database is a powerful and versatile tool, ideal for applications requiring real-time updates.

Its ease of integration, scalability, and offline support make it a popular choice among developers. However, it is important to carefully evaluate its limits, especially in terms of data structure and long-term costs.

If you are looking for a solution to synchronize data in real time, Firebase is undoubtedly an option to consider.

But if you need greater flexibility or control, alternatives like Firestore, Supabase, or AWS AppSync might suit your needs.
