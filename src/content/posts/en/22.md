Standing desks are gaining more and more popularity in offices and work environments, especially in smartworking ones.

The idea of working standing is not new, but with the increase in concerns related to sedentary lifestyle and postural problems, more and more professionals are looking for ergonomic solutions to improve their health and productivity.

Spending many hours sitting can cause a series of problems, including back pain, muscle stiffness and reduced blood circulation.

Standing desks allow alternating between sitting and standing positions, favoring a more natural posture and reducing the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders.

Among the main advantages we find improvement of posture and reduction of back pain, increase in energy and concentration, greater calorie consumption compared to sitting position, reduction of the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes due to excessive sedentary lifestyle.

However, even if standing can bring benefits, it is important not to remain immobile for too long. For this reason, many people combine standing desks with ergonomic seats designed to offer support without compromising posture.

An example is the kneeling chair, which favors better spinal alignment and distributes weight more evenly between pelvis and knees.

These seats bring numerous benefits, including:

reduce pressure on the lumbar area
maintain natural back curvature
improve breathing and circulation

#### Standing desk in HeroHubs

HeroHubs, a reality always attentive to innovation and the future, adopts the smart desks from Autonomous, a company specialized in ergonomic solutions for work.

Their advanced technology offers electronically adjustable desks, ideal for adapting to different work needs. The smart desk we use is particularly suitable for developer work, offering a wide work surface, precise height adjustments and a solid construction that guarantees stability even during long coding sessions.

No resistance problems: we currently use workstations with three 27-inch screens, mounted on VESA arms, tempered glass worktop, for a total of several kilograms of tools. Autonomous guarantees these desks for a load over 100kg.

In the sector there are also other companies that offer excellent ergonomic solutions, guaranteeing valid alternatives for every type of need. For example, Ikea products are not bad: we have received direct feedback from our collaborators who use them and appreciate their quality and functionality with a contained cost.

Adopting a standing desk does not mean eliminating sitting completely. The ideal is to alternate between the two positions during the day.

For those who want to try, but doubtful about the initial transition, we recommend:

start with short periods standing, gradually increasing the time
use an anti-fatigue mat to reduce pressure on feet and legs
adjust the desk height to keep elbows at 90 degrees
change position often and take small movement breaks
Investing in a standing desk and an ergonomic seat can make a difference in daily well-being, improving posture, energy and productivity.

The secret is finding the right balance between sitting and standing positions, listening to the needs of your own body. A small modification in the work environment can translate into great long-term benefits.
