We are immersed, surrounded, fused with technology.

A technological landscape characterized by rapid evolution and increasingly distributed teams. Technical skills, by now, represent only part of professional success.

Of course, knowing how to design solid software architectures or develop them is crucial, but without the ability to relate to others, the value of these skills risks being burned.

Here come soft skills, those interpersonal and behavioral skills that allow effective collaboration, facing challenges, and growing within a team.

#### Why are they fundamental?

A successful technical team is not just a group of people with high technical skills; it is a network of professionals who collaborate, share ideas, and solve problems together.

Soft skills make this interaction possible.

One of the most requested skills is the ability to explain complex ideas in a clear and understandable way, both to technical colleagues and non-technical stakeholders.

Communicating effectively not only reduces misunderstandings, but also accelerates problem resolution, creating a more productive and collaborative work environment.

Teamwork, then, is a constant in the technology world.

Collaborating effectively means building mutual trust, showing respect towards others, and knowing how to accept and provide constructive feedback.

This dynamic not only improves the quality of work, but also promotes a collaborative environment where everyone can give their best.

Let's be clear: a serene environment, where you can be professional even admitting some joke or joking, is much more productive than a context where the fear of saying something wrong or confronting someone more experienced and ready for polemics prevails.

Knowing how to organize one's work represents a key element for managing time and setting the right priorities. This ability is fundamental to meet deadlines and ensure project success without accumulating excessive stress, favoring greater efficiency and a serene approach to daily challenges.

And again, technologies change rapidly, and so do project requirements.

Being open to change and knowing how to adapt is fundamental to remain relevant.

Creative problem solving: even if problem solving is often considered a technical skill, creativity in finding innovative solutions is a soft skill that can make the difference in complex situations.

#### What happens in a technological team?

Imagine a software development project.

A multidisciplinary team works together to create a mobile application.

Each brings specific skills, but without effective communication, the project risks derailing.

Developers might not fully understand the product requirements, designers might not be aligned with technical functionalities, and project managers might struggle to keep everyone on the same line.

There is no sharing of long-term objectives, dangerous deadlines, or criticalities.

Sometimes it is better to reach the goal quickly and optimize later rather than go overtime seeking technological perfection.

In these contexts, soft skills become the glue that holds everything together.

A team leader with good communication skills can translate technical language into understandable terms for everyone, facilitating collaboration.

Likewise, a team member who listens actively can identify potential problems before they become obstacles.

#### How to improve them?

Soft skills are not innate; they can be developed with effort and practice.

We recommend paying attention to these points:

Active listening: learning to pay attention, without interrupting, helps better understand others' needs and points of view;
Requesting feedback: asking for an opinion on one's behaviors and attitudes is a great way to identify areas for improvement;
Participating in workshops or courses: there are numerous courses dedicated to soft skills development, from communication to time management;
Practicing emotional awareness: recognizing and managing one's emotions is fundamental to stay calm in stressful situations and relate effectively with others;
Collaborating actively: getting involved in group projects, even outside work, can help strengthen teamwork skills;

#### Hard skills and soft skills: a matter of balance

While hard skills are often the reason we get hired, soft skills are the reason we stay.

A technical professional who masters both these dimensions becomes an irreplaceable asset for any company.

For example, an excellent programmer but unable to collaborate might slow down a project (if not destroy the team from within due to the generated climate).

A programmer with average skills but great interpersonal abilities can contribute to creating a more productive and harmonious work environment.

The goal is to find a balance between these two areas.

In conclusion: soft skills are an essential component of success in the technology world. They not only improve interpersonal relationships, but also allow better handling of work challenges.

Investing in the development of these skills is not only a smart choice, but a necessity for those who want to stand out in a competitive sector.
