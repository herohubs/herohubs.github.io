Meetings, often perceived as a necessary evil, can become a powerful tool if managed with care and strategy.

They interrupt concentration and cost precious time, but if used properly they can accelerate decision-making processes and foster collaboration.

Every professional knows that meetings can be detrimental to productivity.

They break the workflow and force continuous context switches, but they remain indispensable when it is necessary to discuss ideas quickly, align the team, or address delicate topics. In these cases, nothing is more effective than a direct conversation to resolve problems or make decisions.

Meetings work best when immediate confrontation is required.

Imagine having to wait days for answers to crucial questions: the process would be extremely slow. Moreover, calling a meeting often pushes people to act before the scheduled time, since no one wants to show up unprepared.

Sometimes just 'threatening' a meeting is enough to get the desired results, because the simple idea of having to participate pushes collaborators to complete the work in advance.

#### Before the meeting

Preparation is the key to an effective meeting.

Start by carefully choosing participants: invite only those essential to achieve the set goal. Every additional person without a clear role represents a cost in terms of time and resources. Once the group is defined, establish the meeting's objective and prepare a clear and concise agenda, which can be shared in advance to help everyone arrive prepared.

Moreover, ensure you have all useful information and materials to support the discussion. Preparing data, slides, or reports avoids improvisations and makes the meeting smoother and more effective.

#### During the meeting

The person conducting the meeting has the task of guiding the group towards a clear objective.

Greet participants with a cordial greeting and establish expectations for the meeting, specifying timeframes and objectives.

Introduce the agenda briefly and remind why the meeting was called.

During the discussion, keep the focus on the main points and monitor time.

If someone dwells too long or deviates from the topic, bring them back gently to the center of the discourse.

Moderation requires balance: ensure everyone has the opportunity to contribute without the conversation turning into a monologue.

Before concluding, summarize what emerged, define next steps, and assign responsibilities.

A clear closure ensures that every participant knows what to do and what the deadlines are.

#### After the meeting

The work does not end with the meeting's closure.

Consolidating results is essential to avoid misunderstandings or missteps.

Send a brief summary, commonly called 'minutes', strictly by email, with discussed points, taken decisions, and assigned responsibilities. This document not only clarifies next steps, but also serves as an archive for future consultations.

The email must have a standardized structure and clear.

The subject must include the meeting date and title, facilitating future search. Also the minutes should follow a standard format to reduce reader disorientation. Having dozens of emails named 'minutes' is not a good strategy.

If there are absent people who need to be informed, share with them a concise but complete summary. In this way, everyone remains aligned on developments.

Learning to manage meetings is an indispensable skill for anyone aspiring to leadership roles.

Even if it can seem challenging at first, with time and experience it becomes a natural part of work.

Do not forget that the objective of a meeting is not to fill time, but to make decisions, solve problems, and create value.
