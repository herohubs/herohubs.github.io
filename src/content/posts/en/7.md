When talking about PHP in the web development world, two contrasting opinions often emerge: on one hand, a fundamental and versatile language that gave birth to platforms like WordPress; on the other, code despised by many modern developers.

But is PHP really despised, or is it a misunderstanding? The truth is that PHP is not the problem: the problem is how it's used.

PHP is one of the most accessible programming languages.

This ease of use has led many people, often without solid training, to develop websites without caring about best practices, creating insecure, inefficient, and difficult-to-maintain code. When a poorly designed site comes to light, people tend to blame the language rather than the person who wrote it.

But let's ask ourselves: is it the wrench's fault if someone doesn't know how to repair an engine?

A language is just a tool, and as such reflects the skills of those who use it. This is a concept that applies to every programming language, but in PHP's case, its widespread adoption has made it an easy target.

#### The Security Issue

One of the most frequent criticisms of PHP concerns security.

Many believe that PHP is not a secure language, but this perception is often due to the quality of code written by inexperienced developers. SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, and other common issues are not intrinsic to the language: they are developer errors.

With modern tools and libraries like PDO for secure SQL query management, or established frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, PHP is perfectly equipped to create secure and scalable web applications.

Of course, it requires skills: but which language doesn't?

A true developer doesn't stop at a language's limitations: they find solutions and implement them.

#### A Language That Shaped the Web

You can't ignore PHP's contribution to web development.

Platforms that today support millions of websites, like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, are based on PHP. These CMSs have democratized the web, allowing anyone to create a website without being a programmer.

In recent years, PHP has shown it can evolve.

In the latest versions, the language has made giant strides in terms of performance, modern syntax, and typing.

The adoption of JIT (Just-In-Time compilation) has significantly improved speed, making it competitive even in high-performance contexts.

#### The Prejudice

A good developer can create quality software in PHP, JavaScript, Python, or any other language.

PHP's problem is that its accessibility often makes it the first approach for those new to programming.

This means there are many developers who don't fully understand what it means to write secure and maintainable code.

However, blaming PHP for this is like blaming a hammer for a crooked nail. It's not the tool that's inadequate, but the way it's used.

#### PHP Is Still a Valid Choice

Despite detractors, PHP remains a popular and valid choice.

For various reasons:

Speed of development: PHP is intuitive and allows for rapid prototyping.
Vast community: its widespread adoption guarantees an incredible amount of resources, libraries, and documentation.
Compatibility and affordable hosting: PHP is supported practically everywhere, making it accessible even to those with limited budgets.
Advanced frameworks: tools like Laravel and Symfony make PHP development more structured and modern.
Many of the world's largest sites, like Facebook (at least in its origins), Wikipedia, and Mailchimp, use or have used PHP successfully.

This shows that it's not the language that's outdated, but our perception of it.

PHP's future depends on its ability to attract competent developers and continue evolving to meet modern needs.

Competition with more recent languages like Python or JavaScript (with Node.js) is fierce, but PHP still has much to offer, especially in projects where simplicity, flexibility, and low costs are fundamental.

It's not perfect, but no language is.

Its ease of use has made it one of the most widely used languages, but also one of the most criticized, often due to improper use.

A good developer knows that a project's success depends more on competence and architectural choices than on the language.

Instead of despising PHP, we should focus on what truly matters: training, best practices, and the ability to create quality software.
